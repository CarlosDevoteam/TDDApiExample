When invoking controller GetFizzBuzz, property FizzBuzzValue should return a value according to the rules

Notes:
start with the minimal failing solution
keep the rules in mind and always write just sufficient enough code
do not forget to refactor your code after each passing test
write your assertions relating to the exact requirements

2. For multiples of three return “Fizz” instead of the number

3. For the multiples of five return “Buzz” 

4. For numbers that are multiples of both three and five return “FizzBuzz”.

5. For num thar are no multiples of any, return the number.

6. Test these numbers 0,1,2,3,4,5,7,8,15,25,30,33

7. And negative numbers
